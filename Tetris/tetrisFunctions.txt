1. Ghost Piece: Show a translucent outline of where the current piece will land. This helps players visualize the final position before committing to a move.

3. Next Block Preview: Display a preview of the next block that will appear on the game board. This can help players plan their moves in advance.

Testing:
1. High Score Leaderboard: Keep track of the highest scores achieved by players and display them on a leaderboard. This encourages replayability and competition among players.

1. Hold Block: Allow players to hold a block and use it later. This can provide strategic options and add another layer of complexity to the gameplay.
2. Sound Effects: Add sound effects for actions such as rotating blocks, clearing lines, and game over. This can make the game more engaging and immersive.
3. Power-ups: Introduce power-ups that provide temporary benefits to the player, such as clearing multiple lines at once or slowing down the falling speed.
